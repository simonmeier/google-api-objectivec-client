// Used to specify pricing rules for buyers/advertisers. Each PricePerBuyer in
// an offer can become [0,1] deals. To check if there is a PricePerBuyer for a
// particular buyer or buyer/advertiser pair, we look for the most specific
// matching rule - we first look for a rule matching the buyer and advertiser,
// next a rule with the buyer but an empty advertiser list, and otherwise look
// for a matching rule where no buyer is set.

@interface GTLAdExchangeBuyerPricePerBuyer : GTLObject

// The buyer who will pay this price. If unset, all buyers can pay this price
// (if the advertisers match, and there's no more specific rule matching the
// buyer).
